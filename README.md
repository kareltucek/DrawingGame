This is a simple game-like thing written as a motorics exercise. You may like to use this to exercise dexterity with your pointing device, e.g., mouse, trackball or graphic tablet.

The game draws some objects on screen and the user is supposed to interact with them by mouse. There are currently three types of objects:
- dots - for standard click operation
- line segments - for simple strokes (e.g, hatching with a stylus) (i.e., hold left button and follow the line from point A to point B)
- beziere curve - for precise contour drawing (i.e., hold left button and follow a nontrivial curve)

Graphics design is clean "modern" vector graphics (black/green), with smooth transitions.

Please do NOT use this as an example of my code style. This project is stitched out of another project, which means that some things are pretty inconsistent. Also it was never supposed to be cleanly written.
